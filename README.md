# Media-Mix-Modeling

This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of advertising media channels through the application of a media mix model. The model is designed to optimize advertising budgets, maximizing return on investment (ROI) for various media channels.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to analyze historical advertising data and develop a media mix model that quantifies the relationship between advertising expenditures and business outcomes. By utilizing a budget optimizer, this model helps businesses make data-driven decisions regarding their advertising strategies.

This Jupyter notebook contains the implementation of the media mix model. It incorporates methods derived from established research, providing insights into how advertising spend impacts revenue. The notebook details the following:

## Scripts
- **[bayesian.py](bayesian.py)**: This script implements Bayesian methods to enhance the model's predictive capabilities, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of advertising impacts.

- **[helper.py](helper.py)**: This script contains utility functions that assist in data preprocessing and analysis, streamlining the workflow of the project.

- **[transformations.py](transformations.py)**: This script includes functions for transforming data into suitable formats for analysis and modeling, ensuring data integrity and consistency.

The project employs various analytical techniques, including:

- **Media Mix Modeling**: Quantifies the effectiveness of different advertising channels based on historical data.
- **Budget Optimization**: Provides actionable recommendations for budget allocation to maximize ROI.
- **Bayesian Inference**: Enhances model accuracy by incorporating prior distributions into the analysis.
